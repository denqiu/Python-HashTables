# Python-HashTables
# This project is from CSC231, Introduction to Data Structures.
# This program allows the user to find a book by its ISBN(International Standard Book Number). The program also shows how long it took to search for the book in seconds, depending on load factor. Load factor means the number of slots occupied, depending on the collection of items in the hash table.
